# hack-typefire

this is a script that uses puppeteer to get perfect scores in [typefire.xyz](typefire.xyz) (Check it out it's a pretty cool site!).

## why?

i was bored. i just did it for fun. (if you're the creator of typefire and you're reading this- don't IP ban me uwu).

## how should i use it?

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/carrotfarmer/hack-typefire

cd hack-typefire/

# if you wanna show up on the leaderboard, enter your email and password in a .env file
touch .env

# check out .env.example

# install dependencies (run only one of these)
pnpm install # -> pnpm
npm install  # -> npm
yarn         # -> yarn

# run the script (index.js)
npm run dev # OR
yarn dev    # OR
pnpm dev 
```

again, this was made for fun, please don't do sketchy stuff.
